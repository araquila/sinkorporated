## This file contains a list of symbols as we will use them throughout the design process. The list also contains the units that are associated with them

# General conventions: if there are differences between turboprop and jet engines, add 'jet' or 'tbp' behind the variable; these are the last part of the variable name. For example, if we have the stall speed of a aircraft, we use 'V_stall_tbp'

# Weights are in Newtons!
PW: payload weight                                    [N]

MTOW_jet: maximum take-off weight for a jet           [N]
OEW_jet: operative empty weight for a jet             [N]
FW_jet: fuel weight for a jet                         [N]

MTOW_tbp: maximum take-off weight for a turboprop     [N]
OEW_tbp: operative empty weight for a turboprop       [N]
FW_tbp: fuel weight for a turboprop                   [N]

range_loiter_jet: loiter range for a jet              [m]

range_cruise_tbp: cruise range for a turboprop        [m]
range_loiter_jet: loiter range for a turboprop        [m]
