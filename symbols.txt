## This file contains a list of symbols as we will use them throughout the design process. The list also contains the units that are associated with them

# General conventions: if there are differences between turboprop and jet engines, add 'jet' or 'tbp' behind the variable; these are the last part of the variable name. For example, if we have the stall speed of a aircraft, we use 'V_stall_tbp'

# Weights are in Newton!
MTOW_jet: maximum take-off weight for a jet           [N]
MTOW_tbp: maximum take-off weight for a turboprop     [N]

OEW_jet: operative empty weight for a jet             [N]
OEW_tbp: operative empty weight for a turboprop       [N]

FW_jet: fuel weight for a jet                         [N]
FW_tbp: fuel weight for a turboprop                   [N]



# Velocities are in m/s!
V_cruise_jet: cruise speed for a jet                  [N]
V_stall_jet: stall speed for a jet                    [N]
V_TO_jet: take-off speed for a jet
V_landing_jet: landing speed for a jet
V_max_jet: maximum speed for a jet

V_cruise_tbp: cruise speed for a turboprop
V_stall_tbp: stall speed for a turboprop
V_TO_tbp: take-off speed for a turboprop
V_landing_tbp: landing speed for a turboprop
V_max_tbp: maximum speed for a turboprop
