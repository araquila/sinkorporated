## This file contains a list of symbols as we will use them throughout the design process. The list also contains the units that are associated with them

# General conventions: if there are differences between turboprop and jet engines, add 'jet' or 'tbp' behind the variable; these are the last part of the variable name. For example, if we have the stall speed of a aircraft, we use 'V_stall_tbp'
