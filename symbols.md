## This file contains a list of symbols as we will use them throughout the design process. The list also contains the units that are associated with them

# General conventions: if there are differences between turboprop and jet engines, add 'jet' or 'tbp' behind the variable

# Weights are in Newton!
MTOW_jet: maximum take-off weight for a jet           [N]
MTOW_tbp: maximum take-off weight for a turboprop     [N]

OEW_jet: operative empty weight for a jet             [N]
OEW_tbp: operative empty weight for a turboprop       [N]

FW_jet: fuel weight for a jet                         [N]
FW_tbp: fuel weight for a turboprop                   [N]
